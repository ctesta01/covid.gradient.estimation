A range of factors and spatial–temporal terms are incorporated into the model. The non-linear and interactive effects of the neighborhood-level factors, i.e., population density and average of income, are modeled as a two-dimensional spline smoother. The change of spatial pattern over time is modeled as a three-dimensional tensor product smoother. By fitting this model, the space–time effect can uncover the underlying spatial–temporal pattern that is not explained by the covariates. The performance of the modeling method based on the individual data is also compared to the modeling methods based on the aggregated data in terms of in-sample and out-of-sample predictive checking. The results suggest that the individual-level based analysis provided a better overall model fit and higher predictive accuracy for detecting epidemic peaks in this application as compared to the analysis based on the aggregated data.},

In this article we further substantiate the success story of GAMs, demonstrating their flexibility by focusing on three relevant pandemic-related issues. First, we examine the interdepency among infections in different age groups, concentrating on school children. In this context, we derive the setting under which parameter estimates are independent of the (unknown) case-detection ratio, which plays an important role in COVID-19 surveillance data. Second, we model the incidence of hospitalizations, for which data is only available with a temporal delay. We illustrate how correcting for this reporting delay through a nowcasting procedure can be naturally incorporated into the GAM framework as an offset term. Third, we propose a multinomial model for the weekly occupancy of intensive care units (ICU), where we distinguish between the number of COVID-19 patients, other patients and vacant beds. With these three examples, we aim to showcase the practical and ?off-the-shelf? applicability of GAMs to gain new insights from real-world data.},

Future work will continue to assess the influence of vaccines, including booster doses, as the pandemic progresses, and new variants emerge.Policy ImplicationsThis work highlights the importance of attaining full (two-dose) vaccination status and reinforces the notion that a second dose provides increased non-additive protection.

	abstract = {During 2020, the infection rate of COVID-19 has been investigated by many scholars from different research fields. In this context, reliable and interpretable forecasts of disease incidents are a vital tool for policymakers to manage healthcare resources. In this context, several experts have called for the necessity to account for human mobility to explain the spread of COVID-19. Existing approaches often apply standard models of the respective research field, frequently restricting modeling possibilities. For instance, most statistical or epidemiological models cannot directly incorporate unstructured data sources, including relational data that may encode human mobility. In contrast, machine learning approaches may yield better predictions by exploiting these data structures yet lack intuitive interpretability as they are often categorized as black-box models. We propose a combination of both research directions and present a multimodal learning framework that amalgamates statistical regression and machine learning models for predicting local COVID-19 cases in Germany. Results and implications: the novel approach introduced enables the use of a richer collection of data types, including mobility flows and colocation probabilities, and yields the lowest mean squared error scores throughout the observational period in the reported benchmark study. The results corroborate that during most of the observational period more dispersed meeting patterns and a lower percentage of people staying put are associated with higher infection rates. Moreover, the analysis underpins the necessity of including mobility data and showcases the flexibility and interpretability of the proposed approach.},

	doi = {10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30553-3},
	abstract = {Background
Within 4 months of COVID-19 first being reported in the USA, it spread to every state and to more than 90\% of all counties. During this period, the US COVID-19 response was highly decentralised, with stay-at-home directives issued by state and local officials, subject to varying levels of enforcement. The absence of a centralised policy and timeline combined with the complex dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission in the USA a challenge.
Methods
We used daily mobility data derived from aggregated and anonymised cell (mobile) phone data, provided by Teralytics (Zürich, Switzerland) from Jan 1 to April 20, 2020, to capture real-time trends in movement patterns for each US county, and used these data to generate a social distancing metric. We used epidemiological data to compute the COVID-19 growth rate ratio for a given county on a given day. Using these metrics, we evaluated how social distancing, measured by the relative change in mobility, affected the rate of new infections in the 25 counties in the USA with the highest number of confirmed cases on April 16, 2020, by fitting a statistical model for each county.
Findings
Our analysis revealed that mobility patterns are strongly correlated with decreased COVID-19 case growth rates for the most affected counties in the USA, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 0·7 for 20 of the 25 counties evaluated. Additionally, the effect of changes in mobility patterns, which dropped by 35–63\% relative to the normal conditions, on COVID-19 transmission are not likely to be perceptible for 9–12 days, and potentially up to 3 weeks, which is consistent with the incubation time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 plus additional time for reporting. We also show evidence that behavioural changes were already underway in many US counties days to weeks before state-level or local-level stay-at-home policies were implemented, implying that individuals anticipated public health directives where social distancing was adopted, despite a mixed political message.
Interpretation
This study strongly supports a role of social distancing as an effective way to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the USA. Until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, social distancing will remain one of the primary measures to combat disease spread, and these findings should serve to support more timely policy making around social distancing in the USA in the future.

This study examined county-level racial/ethnic disparities in human mobility and COVID-19 health outcomes during the year 2020 by leveraging geo-tracking data across the contiguous US. Sets of generalized additive models were fitted under cross-sectional and time-varying settings, with percentage of mobility change, percentage of staying home, COVID-19 infection rate, and case-fatality ratio as dependent variables, respectively. After adjusting for spatial effects, built environment, socioeconomics, demographics, and partisanship, we found counties with higher Asian populations decreased most in travel, counties with higher White and Asian populations experienced the least infection rate, and counties with higher African American populations presented the highest case-fatality ratio. Control variables, particularly partisanship and education attainment, significantly influenced modeling results. Time-varying analyses further suggested racial differences in human mobility varied dramatically at the beginning but remained stable during the pandemic, while racial differences in COVID-19 outcomes broadly decreased over time. All conclusions hold robust with different aggregation units or model specifications. Altogether, our analyses shine a spotlight on the entrenched racial segregation in the US as well as how it may influence the mobility patterns, urban forms, and health disparities during the COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Objective To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus. Methods We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R0 from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors—population between 20–34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality—as having strong relationships with R0, across countries. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R0 but were positive. Conclusion Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.},

	abstract = {Health inequities have long defined health and the healthcare system in the USA. The clinical and research capacity across the USA is unparalleled, yet compared to other high and even some middle-income countries, the average health indicators of the population remain suboptimal in 2020, a finding at least in part explained by inequity in healthcare access. In this context, COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a major threat to the public’s health. While it was initially thought that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 would be the great equaliser as it would not discriminate, it is clear that COVID-19 incidence and mortality have rapidly reinforced health disparities drawn by historical and contemporary inequities. Here, we synthesise the data highlighting specific risks among particular marginalised and under-resourced communities including those in jails, prisons and detention centers, immigrants and the undocumented, people with disabilities and people experiencing homelessness across the USA. The drivers of these disparities are pervasive structural risks including limited access to preventive services, inability to comply with physical distancing recommendations, underlying health disparities and intersecting stigmas particularly affecting racial and ethnic minorities across the country, including African Americans, Latinx Americans and Native Americans. Advancing the COVID-19 response, saving lives and restarting the economy necessitate rapidly addressing these inequities rather than ignoring and even reinforcing them.},

Ageism and stereotypes of older people in general can have an important impact on elders’ physical and mental health and well-being. For example, internalized negative stereotypes can produce self-fulfilling prophecies through stereotype embodiment and contribute to weakness and dependency. Ageist beliefs and stereotypes can interfere with health care seeking as well as with diagnosis and treatment recommendations; they can, for example, contribute to gender disparities in the health care of older adults if older women are perceived as too frail to undergo aggressive treatments. Ageism also results in disrespectful treatment of older patients, which is communicated through baby talk and other forms of infantilization or the shrugging off of patients’ complaints and concerns as “just old age.” Intersectional identities can result in a cumulative burden for older women patients who may have a history of disrespectful treatment for other reasons (e.g., sexism, racism, bias against lesbians). Reduction of ageism and sexism and promotion of more realistic and diverse views of older women could improve doctor–patient relationships, facilitate adherence to treatment regimens, and reduce disparities in health and health care.},

	abstract = {Background Probability and nonprobability-based studies of US transgender persons identify different disparities in health and health care access. Objectives We used TransPop, the first US national probability survey of transgender persons, to describe and compare measures of health and health access among transgender, nonbinary, and cisgender participants. We directly compared the results with 2015 US Transgender Survey (USTS) data and with previously published analyses from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Methods All participants were screened by Gallup Inc., which recruited a probability sample of US adults. Transgender people were identified using a two-step screening process. Eligible participants completed self-administered questionnaires (transgender n = 274, cisgender n = 1162). We obtained weighted proportions/means, then tested for differences between gender groups. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate associations. Bivariate analyses were conducted using the weighted USTS data set for shared variables in USTS and TransPop. Results Transgender participants were younger and more racially diverse compared to the cisgender group. Despite equally high insurance coverage, transgender people more often avoided care due to cost concerns. Nonbinary persons were less likely to access transgender-related health care providers/clinics than transgender men and women. Transgender respondents more often rated their health as fair/poor, with more frequently occuring poor physical and mental health days compared to cisgender participants. Health conditions including HIV, emphysema, and ulcer were higher among transgender people. TransPop and USTS, unlike BRFSS-based analyses, showed no differences in health or health access. Discussion Transgender persons experience health access disparities centered on avoidance of care due to cost beyond insured status. Health disparities correspond with models of minority stress, with nonbinary persons having distinct health/health access patterns. Despite different sampling methods, USTS and TransPop appear more similar than BRFSS studies regarding health/health access. Conclusion Future research should elucidate health care costs for transgender and nonbinary people, while addressing methodology in national studies of transgender health.},

	abstract = {Background
The LGBTQ health disparities literature documents barriers to comprehensive and queer-inclusive care. Queer cisgender women and gender expansive individuals assigned female at birth experience myriad health disparities related to reproductive health, in part owing to the health care system. However, few studies have examined how queer individuals cope with and overcome barriers to queer-competent reproductive health care. This study aims to understand the strategies queer cisgender women and gender expansive individuals use to meet their reproductive health needs.
Methods
Investigators conducted interviews with 22 queer cisgender women and gender expansive individuals assigned female at birth about their experiences seeking reproductive health care services. We used inductive coding and thematic analysis to identify themes related to meeting reproductive health and health care needs.
Results
Findings highlight the prevalence of negative and harmful experiences while seeking reproductive health care. In response to these negative experiences, individuals developed active strategies to meet their health needs, including seeking information and community, seeking alternative models of care, and managing identity disclosure. Importantly, these strategies varied in effectiveness, depending on participants' social and economic advantage.
Conclusions
Queer individuals face numerous barriers to queer-competent reproductive health care when seeking reproductive health services. While queer patients are often resilient and creative, developing strategies to get their needs met, the presence of such strategies highlights the need for structural changes in the health system to better serve queer patients.},

	abstract = {Background Prior studies have noted significant health disadvantages experienced by LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) populations in the US. While several studies have identified that fears or experiences of stigma and disclosure of sexual orientation and/or gender identity to health care providers are significant barriers to health care utilization for LGBT people, these studies have concentrated almost exclusively on urban samples. Little is known about the impact of stigma specifically for rural LGBT populations, who may have less access to quality, LGBT-sensitive care than LGBT people in urban centers. Methodology LBGT individuals residing in rural areas of the United States were recruited online to participate in a survey examining the relationship between stigma, disclosure and “outness,” and utilization of primary care services. Data were collected and analyzed regarding LGBT individuals’ demographics, health care access, health risk factors, health status, outness to social contacts and primary care provider, and anticipated, internalized, and enacted stigmas. Results Higher scores on stigma scales were associated with lower utilization of health services for the transgender \& non-binary group, while higher levels of disclosure of sexual orientation were associated with greater utilization of health services for cisgender men. Conclusions The results demonstrate the role of stigma in shaping access to primary health care among rural LGBT people and point to the need for interventions focused towards decreasing stigma in health care settings or increasing patients’ disclosure of orientation or gender identity to providers. Such interventions have the potential to increase utilization of primary and preventive health care services by LGBT people in rural areas.},

We provide empirical illustrations to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed tests. The finite sample size and power performance of the tests are also investigated through a Monte Carlo study. The results indicate that the adjusted LM tests have good finite sample properties. In addition, they prove to be more suitable for the identification of the source of dependence (lag or error) than their unadjusted counterparts.},

	abstract = {Background
People from racial minority groups in western countries experience disproportionate socioeconomic and structural determinants of health disadvantages. These disadvantages have led to inequalities and inequities in health care access and poorer health outcomes. We report disproportionate disparities in prevalence, hospitalisation, and deaths from COVID-19 by racial minority populations.

Methods
We conducted a systematic literature search of relevant databases to identify studies reporting on prevalence, hospitalisations, and deaths from COVID-19 by race groups between 01 January 2020 – 15 April 2021. We grouped race categories into Blacks, Hispanics, Whites and Others. Random effects model using the method of DerSimonian and Laird were fitted, and forest plot with respective ratio estimates and 95\% confidence interval (CI) for each race category, and subgroup meta-regression analyses and the overall pooled ratio estimates for prevalence, hospitalisation and mortality rate were presented.

Results
Blacks experienced significantly higher burden of COVID-19: prevalence ratio 1.79 (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.59-1.99), hospitalisation ratio 1.87 (95\% CI = 1.69-2.04), mortality ratio 1.68 (95\% CI = 1.52-1.83), compared to Whites: prevalence ratio 0.70 (95\% CI = 0.0.64-0.77), hospitalisation ratio 0.74 (95\% CI = 0.65-0.82), mortality ratio 0.82 (95\% CI = 0.78-0.87). Also, Hispanics experienced a higher burden: prevalence ratio 1.78 (95\% CI = 1.63-1.94), hospitalisation ratio 1.32 (95\% CI = 1.08-1.55), mortality ratio 0.94 (95\% CI = 0.84-1.04) compared to Whites. A higher burden was also observed for Other race groups: prevalence ratio 1.43 (95\% CI = 1.19-1.67), hospitalisation ratio 1.12 (95\% CI = 0.89-1.35), mortality ratio 1.06 (95\% CI = 0.89-1.23) compared to Whites. The disproportionate burden among Blacks and Hispanics remained following correction for publication bias.

Conclusions
Blacks and Hispanics have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. This is deeply concerning and highlights the systemically entrenched disadvantages (social, economic, and political) experienced by racial minorities in western countries; and this study underscores the need to address inequities in these communities to improve overall health outcomes.},

	abstract = {The United States (US) has been among those nations most severely affected by the first—and subsequent—phases of the pandemic of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. With only 4\% of the worldwide population, the US has seen about 22\% of COVID-19 deaths. Despite formidable advantages in resources and expertise, presently the per capita mortality rate is over 585/million, respectively 2.4 and 5 times higher compared to Canada and Germany. As we enter Fall 2020, the US is enduring ongoing outbreaks across large regions of the country. Moreover, within the US, an early and persistent feature of the pandemic has been the disproportionate impact on populations already made vulnerable by racism and dangerous jobs, inadequate wages, and unaffordable housing, and this is true for both the headline public health threat and the additional disastrous economic impacts. In this article we assess the impact of missteps by the Federal Government in three specific areas: the introduction of the virus to the US and the establishment of community transmission; the lack of national COVID-19 workplace standards and enforcement, and lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for workplaces as represented by complaints to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) which we find are correlated with deaths 16 days later (ρ = 0.83); and the total excess deaths in 2020 to date already total more than 230,000, while COVID-19 mortality rates exhibit severe—and rising—inequities in race/ethnicity, including among working age adults.},

	abstract = {Objective:
To overcome the absence of national, state, and local public health data on the unequal economic and social burden of COVID-19 in the United States. 
Design:
We analyze US county COVID-19 deaths and confirmed COVID-19 cases and positive COVID-19
tests in Illinois and New York City zip codes by area percent poverty, percent crowding, percent population of color, and the Index of Concentration at the Extremes. 
Setting:
US counties and zip codes in Illinois and New York City, as of May 5, 2020. 
Main Outcome
Measures:
Rates, rate differences, and rate ratios of COVID-19 mortality, confirmed cases, and positive tests by category of county and zip code–level area-based socioeconomic measures. 
Results:
As of May 5, 2020, the COVID-19 death rate per 100 000 person-years
equaled the following: 143.2 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 140.9, 145.5) vs 83.3 (95\% CI: 78.3, 88.4) in high versus low poverty counties (≥20\% vs {\textless}5\% of persons below poverty); 124.4 (95\% CI: 122.7, 126.0) versus 48.2 (95\% CI: 47.2, 49.2) in counties in the top versus bottom quintile
for household crowding; and 127.7 (95\% CI: 126.0, 129.4) versus 25.9 (95\% CI: 25.1, 26.6) for counties in the top versus bottom quintile for the percentage of persons who are people of color. Socioeconomic gradients in Illinois confirmed cases and New York City positive tests by zip code–level
area-based socioeconomic measures were also observed. 
Conclusions:
Stark social inequities exist in the United States for COVID-19 outcomes. We recommend that public health departments use these straightforward cost-effective methods to report on social inequities in COVID-19
outcomes to provide an evidence base for policy and resource allocation.},

The objective of the study is to understand the spatial determinants of the pandemic in counties across the U.S. by comparing socioeconomic variables to case and death data from January 22nd to June 30th 2020. A cluster analysis was performed to examine areas of high-risk, followed by a three-stage regression to examine contextual factors associated with elevated risk patterns for morbidity and mortality. The factors associated with community-level vulnerability included age, disability, language, race, occupation, and urban status. We recommend that cluster detection and spatial analysis be included in population-based surveillance strategies to better inform early case detection and prioritize healthcare resources.},

A cross-sectional research design linked data from Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services, American Community Survey, the 2010 Census, and COVID-19 cases among the general population and nursing homes. Spatial cluster analysis identified specific regions with statistically higher COVID-19 cases and deaths among residents. Multivariate analysis identified risk factors at the nursing home level including, total count of fines, total staffing levels, and LPN staffing levels. County-level or place-based factors like per-capita income, average household size, population density, and minority composition were significant predictors of COVID-19 cases in the nursing home.

Due to inadequate research on geographic modeling of COVID-19, we investigated county-level variations of disease incidence across the continental United States. We compiled a geodatabase of 35 environmental, socioeconomic, topographic, and demographic variables that could explain the spatial variability of disease incidence. Further, we employed spatial lag and spatial error models to investigate spatial dependence and geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) models to locally examine spatial non-stationarity. The results suggested that even though incorporating spatial autocorrelation could significantly improve the performance of the global ordinary least square model, these models still represent a significantly poor performance compared to the local models. Moreover, MGWR could explain the highest variations (adj. R2: 68.1\%) with the lowest AICc compared to the others. Mapping the effects of significant explanatory variables (i.e., income inequality, median household income, the proportion of black females, and the proportion of nurse practitioners) on spatial variability of COVID-19 incidence rates using MGWR could provide useful insights to policymakers for targeted interventions.},

The nature of the pandemic makes spatiotemporal methods essential to understanding the distribution of COVID-19 deaths and developing interventions. This study examines the spatiotemporal trends in COVID-19 death rates in the United States from March 2020 to May 2021 by performing an emerging hot spot analysis (EHSA). It then investigates the effects of the COVID-19 time-dependent and basic social vulnerability factors on COVID-19 death rates using geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR). The EHSA results demonstrate that over the three phases of the pandemic (first wave, second wave, and post-vaccine deployment), hot spots have shifted from densely populated cities and the states with a high percentage of socially vulnerable individuals to the states with relatively relaxed social distancing requirements, and then to the states with low vaccination rates. The GTWR results suggest that local infection and testing rates, social distancing interventions, and other social, environmental, and health risk factors show significant associations with COVID-19 death rates, but these associations vary over time and space. These findings can inform public health planning.},

	abstract = {Evidence from the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. indicated that the virus had vastly different effects across races, with black Americans faring worse on dimensions including illness, hospitalization and death. New data suggests that our understanding of the pandemic’s racial inequities must be revised given the closing of the gap between black and white COVID-related mortality. Initial explanations for inequality in COVID-related outcomes concentrated on static factors—e.g., geography, urbanicity, segregation or age-structures—that are insufficient on their own to explain observed time-varying patterns in inequality. Drawing from a literature suggesting the relevance of political factors in explaining pandemic outcomes, we highlight the importance of political polarization—the partisan divide in pandemic-related policies and beliefs—that varies over time and across geographic units. Specifically, we investigate the role of polarization through two political factors, public opinion and state-level public health policies, using fine-grained data on disparities in public concern over COVID and in state containment/health policies to understand the changing pattern of inequality in mortality. We show that (1) apparent decreases in inequality are driven by increasing total deaths—mostly among white Americans—rather than decreasing mortality among black Americans (2) containment policies are associated with decreasing inequality, likely resulting from lower relative mortality among Blacks (3) as the partisan disparity in Americans who were “unconcerned” about COVID increased, racial inequality in COVID mortality decreased, generating the appearance of greater equality consistent with a “race to the bottom’’ explanation as overall deaths increased and substantively swamping the effects of containment policies.},

We explore county level associations between COVID-19 attributed deaths and social, demographic, vulnerability, and political variables to develop a better understanding of the evolving roles these variables play in relation to mortality. We focus on the role of political variables, as captured by support for either the Republican or Democrat presidential candidates in the 2020 elections and the stringency of state-wide governor mandates, during three non-overlapping time periods between February 2020 and February 2021. We find that during the first three months of the pandemic, Democratic-leaning and internationally-connected urban counties were affected. During subsequent months (between May and September, 2020), Republican counties with high percentages of Hispanic and Black populations were most hardly hit. Importantly, in the time period between October 2020 and February 2021, when the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing and wearing masks indoors, had been well-established. During this period, we find that Republican-leaning counties experienced up to 3 times higher death rates than Democratic-leaning counties, even after controlling for multiple social vulnerability factors. We also find that Republican-leaning counties in states with less strict mandates experienced the most severe outbreaks. Our findings suggest that ideologies promoted by prominent political actors may not align with efforts to mitigate the impact of the ongoing pandemic and prevent deaths.},

Data on education levels, ethnicity, race, percentage at or below the poverty level, and percentage single-parent households were collected from the 2019 census for 974 Florida ZIP codes. We used hotspot analysis to measure spatial clustering of Publix vaccination sites per 100,000 people. We identified hot spots (areas with greater vaccine availability) in moderately populated areas where the population was significantly older, richer, and Whiter than in areas of lower vaccine availability (cold spots). Cold spots were identified in areas of low and high population density, areas with a higher proportion of Hispanic residents, and areas with a higher proportion of single-parent households, including Miami-Dade County and inland regions of Florida. Multivariate analysis showed strong associations between the number of vaccination sites in a ZIP code and race and ethnicity and a weaker association with percentage of residents at or below the poverty level. Future vaccine distribution should continue to be monitored through a socioeconomic lens to help prevent unequal access.},

	abstract = {Background The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has repeatedly called for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine equity. The objective our study was to measure equity in the early distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to healthcare facilities across the US. Specifically, we tested whether the likelihood of a healthcare facility administering COVID-19 vaccines in May 2021 differed by county-level racial composition and degree of urbanicity. Methods and findings The outcome was whether an eligible vaccination facility actually administered COVID-19 vaccines as of May 2021, and was defined by spatially matching locations of eligible and actual COVID-19 vaccine administration locations. The outcome was regressed against county-level measures for racial/ethnic composition, urbanicity, income, social vulnerability index, COVID-19 mortality, 2020 election results, and availability of nontraditional vaccination locations using generalized estimating equations. Across the US, 61.4\% of eligible healthcare facilities and 76.0\% of eligible pharmacies provided COVID-19 vaccinations as of May 2021. Facilities in counties with {\textgreater}42.2\% non-Hispanic Black population (i.e., {\textgreater} 95th county percentile of Black race composition) were less likely to serve as COVID-19 vaccine administration locations compared to facilities in counties with {\textless}12.5\% non-Hispanic Black population (i.e., lower than US average), with OR 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.70 to 0.98, p = 0.030. Location of a facility in a rural county (OR 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.75 to 0.90, p {\textless} 0.001, versus metropolitan county) or in a county in the top quintile of COVID-19 mortality (OR 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.75 to 0.93, p = 0.001, versus bottom 4 quintiles) was associated with decreased odds of serving as a COVID-19 vaccine administration location. There was a significant interaction of urbanicity and racial/ethnic composition: In metropolitan counties, facilities in counties with {\textgreater}42.2\% non-Hispanic Black population (i.e., {\textgreater}95th county percentile of Black race composition) had 32\% (95\% CI 14\% to 47\%, p = 0.001) lower odds of serving as COVID administration facility compared to facilities in counties with below US average Black population. This association between Black composition and odds of a facility serving as vaccine administration facility was not observed in rural or suburban counties. In rural counties, facilities in counties with above US average Hispanic population had 26\% (95\% CI 11\% to 38\%, p = 0.002) lower odds of serving as vaccine administration facility compared to facilities in counties with below US average Hispanic population. This association between Hispanic ethnicity and odds of a facility serving as vaccine administration facility was not observed in metropolitan or suburban counties. Our analyses did not include nontraditional vaccination sites and are based on data as of May 2021, thus they represent the early distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Our results based on this cross-sectional analysis may not be generalizable to later phases of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution process. Conclusions Healthcare facilities in counties with higher Black composition, in rural areas, and in hardest-hit communities were less likely to serve as COVID-19 vaccine administration locations in May 2021. The lower uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations among minority populations and rural areas has been attributed to vaccine hesitancy; however, decreased access to vaccination sites may be an additional overlooked barrier.},

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have estimated that COVID-19 case and hospitalization rates are at least 2.5 and 4.5 times higher, respectively, among Black, Hispanic, and Native American populations than among White populations. Black individuals have died from COVID-19 at more than twice the rate as White individuals. Area-based studies have similarly revealed elevated COVID-19 infection and death rates in socially disadvantaged counties with larger racial and ethnic minority populations. In the context of intergenerational, structural inequalities in the United States, these trends are as devastating as they are unsurprising. The need to elucidate factors associated with COVID-19 inequity and identify tangible action steps continues.

	abstract = {This paper compares ZIP code-level data on observed COVID-19 testing and case rates for the City of Chicago and New York City to better understand both: (i) the extent to which racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 testing and case rates exist at the neighbourhood level; and (ii) the most important neighbourhood-level drivers of these observed disparities. Through exploratory spatial mapping and econometric approaches, the paper finds that, across both cities, Hispanic-majority neighbourhoods have significantly lower testing rates than other racial/ethnic neighbourhood types, even when controlling for observed infection rates—which are also significantly higher for Hispanic-majority neighbourhoods. At the same time, White-majority neighbourhoods have significantly higher testing rates and lower observed infection rates. Given this observed disparity, the paper also examines a range of underlying factors that are potentially driving observed neighbourhood-level COVID-19 case rates. The findings suggest that higher socio-economic status and the provision of healthy, active built environments are significantly negatively associated with COVID-19 infection rates, while several aspects of social vulnerability are significant positive predictors of COVID-19 infection rates. These findings suggest that the health benefits from higher density, walkable built environments may play a larger “protective” role from observed COVID-19 case rates at the neighbourhood-level than previously assumed, while at the same time indicating that the increased prevalence of COVID-19 in Hispanic- and Black-majority neighbourhoods may be in part due to their greater risk of occupational exposure and multi-generational household structure (particularly for Hispanic-majority neighbourhoods).},

	abstract = {The onset of human disease by infection with SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 has revealed risk factors for disease severity. There are four identified factors that put one at high risk for infection and/or mortality creating a disparity: age, co-morbidities, race/ethnicity and gender. Data indicate that the older a person is, and/or the presence of obesity and diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease place one at higher risk for COVID-19. In the United States, specific race/ethnicities, particularly African Americans and Native Americans, are strong COVID-19 risk components. Male gender has also emerged as a severity risk factor. For age and racial/ethnicities, the accumulation of health co-morbidities is common precipitating mechanisms. In particular, underlying socio-economic structures in the United States likely drive development of co-morbidities, putting affected populations at higher risk for severe COVID-19. Sudden cardiac death triggered by a common sodium channel variant in African Americans with COVID-19 has not been evaluated as a cause for racial disparity. There is no evidence that racial/ethnic differences for COVID-19 are caused by ABO blood groups, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or from amino acid substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There is growing evidence that androgen-enabled expression of ACE2 receptors and the serine protease TMPRSS2, two permissive elements engaging the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for infection, may contribute to severe COVID-19 in men. Overall, COVID-19 has generated disparities for who is infected and the severity of that infection. Understanding the mechanisms for the disparity will help nullify the differences in risk for COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Background
There is limited prior investigation of the combined influence of personal and community-level socioeconomic factors on racial/ethnic disparities in individual risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Methods
We performed a cross-sectional analysis nested within a prospective cohort of 2,102,364 participants from March 29, 2020 in the United States (US) and March 24, 2020 in the United Kingdom (UK) through December 02, 2020 via the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application. We examined the contribution of community-level deprivation using the Neighborhood Deprivation Index (NDI) and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) to observe racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 incidence. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04331509.
Findings
Compared with non-Hispanic White participants, the risk for a positive COVID-19 test was increased in the US for non-Hispanic Black (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.18–1.47) and Hispanic participants (OR, 1.42; 95\% CI, 1.33–1.52) and in the UK for Black (OR, 1.17; 95\% CI, 1.02–1.34), South Asian (OR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.30–1.49), and Middle Eastern participants (OR, 1.38; 95\% CI, 1.18–1.61). This elevated risk was associated with living in more deprived communities according to the NDI/IMD. After accounting for downstream mediators of COVID-19 risk, community-level deprivation still mediated 16.6\% and 7.7\% of the excess risk in Black compared to White participants in the US and the UK, respectively.
Interpretation
Our results illustrate the critical role of social determinants of health in the disproportionate COVID-19 risk experienced by racial and ethnic minorities.

Data on COVID-19 incidence and mortality were collected from January 20 to July 29, 2020. The association of social risk factors with weekly cumulative incidence and mortality was also examined by interacting time with the index measures, using a random intercept to account for repeated measures.Sociodemographic data from publicly available data sets, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), which includes subindices of socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, racial/ethnic minority and English language proficiency status, and housing and transportation.As of July 29, 2020, there were a total of 4 289 283 COVID-19 cases and 147 074 COVID-19 deaths in the US. An increase of 0.1 point in SVI score was associated with a 14.3\% increase in incidence rate (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.16; P \&lt; .001) and 13.7\% increase in mortality rate (IRR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.12-1.16; P \&lt; .001), or an excess of 87 COVID-19 cases and 3 COVID-19 deaths per 100 000 population for a SVI score change from 0.5 to 0.6 in a midsize metropolitan county; subindices were also associated with both outcomes. A 0.1-point increase in the overall SVI was associated with a 0.9\% increase in weekly cumulative increase in incidence rate (IRR, 1.01; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.01; P \&lt; .001) and 0.5\% increase in mortality rate (IRR, 1.01; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.01; P \&lt; .001).In this cross-sectional study, a wide range of sociodemographic risk factors, including socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic minority status, household composition, and environmental factors, were significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality. To address inequities in the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, these social vulnerabilities and their root causes must be addressed.},

Point estimates for rate ratios were consistently greatest for the novel ICE that jointly measured extreme concentrations of income and race/ethnicity. For example, the census tract–level rate ratio for infant mortality comparing the bottom versus top quintile for an ICE contrasting low-income Black versus high-income White equaled 2.93 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.11, 4.09), but was 2.19 (95\% CI = 1.59, 3.02) for low versus high income, 2.77 (95\% CI = 2.02, 3.81) for Black versus White, and 1.56 (95\% CI = 1.19, 2.04) for census tracts with greater than or equal to 30\% versus less than 10\% below poverty., Conclusions. The ICE may be a useful metric for public health monitoring, as it simultaneously captures extremes of privilege and deprivation and can jointly measure economic and racial/ethnic segregation.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disproportionately burdens communities of color in the United States. The prevalence of preexisting conditions in these populations has not accounted for the observed health inequities. A growing body of research indicates a significant role of racialized residential segregation and income inequality on health outcomes. The Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) is a metric which captures socio-spatial and economic polarization that has proven to be a valuable predictor of a large variety of health outcomes.

Objectives: The primary objective of this ecologic study was to determine the impact of socio-spatial and economic segregation on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) morbidity and mortality in Georgia.

Methods: The ICE scores for racial/ethnic, economic, and racialized economic segregation for each county in Georgia (n=159) were calculated and investigated as predictors of increased SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate, case-hospitalization rate, and case-mortality rate after controlling for the prevalence of preexisting conditions (diabetes, obesity, and smoking) and potential barriers to care (uninsured rate).

Results: Counties with the largest income disparity had 1.57 times the case rate (p{\textless}0.0001) and 1.7 times (p{\textless}0.01) the case-mortality rate compared to the most privileged counties. Cases in counties with the largest racialized economic segregation were 1.8 times more likely to be hospitalized (p{\textless}0.0001).

Conclusion: Racialized economic segregation is a strong correlate of pandemic health inequities in Georgia and highlights the need for structural interventions to address barriers to minority and vulnerable population health. Increased focus and efforts to address the structural and systematic barriers faced by communities of color is necessary to address health inequities.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on American life. However, the burden of the pandemic has not been distributed equally. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether racial and economic residential segregation were associated with COVID-19 related factors in the nation's capital, Washington D.C., during the first year of the pandemic.
Methods
Racial, economic, and racialized economic segregation were assessed using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes measure and data from the 2014–2018 American Community Survey. COVID-19 related factors (i.e., incidence, testing rate, and percent positivity) were assessed using data from the Washington D.C. government. Spearman rank correlation was used to assess the relationship between each segregation measure and each COVID-19 related factor.
Results
Washington D.C. neighborhoods with a higher concentration of African Americans, lower income residents, and African Americans with low income had a higher incidence of COVID-19 and greater percent positivity, but lower testing rates compared to their counterparts.
Conclusions
There is a geographic mismatch between neighborhoods most vulnerable to COVID-19 and the neighborhoods where the testing resources are being used. More resources should be allocated to the most vulnerable neighborhoods to address the COVID-19 pandemic in an equitable manner.},

	abstract = {Extensive research shows that residential segregation has severe health consequences for racial and ethnic minorities. Most research to date has operationalized segregation in terms of either poverty or race/ethnicity rather than a synergy of these factors. A novel version of the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICERace-Income) specifically assesses racialized economic segregation in terms of spatial concentrations of racial and economic privilege (e.g., wealthy white people) versus disadvantage (e.g., poor Black people) within a given area. This multidimensional measure advances a more comprehensive understanding of residential segregation and its consequences for racial and ethnic minorities. The aim of this paper is to critically review the evidence on the association between ICERace-Income and health outcomes. We implemented the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to conduct a rigorous search of academic databases for papers linking ICERace-Income with health. Twenty articles were included in the review. Studies focused on the association of ICERace-Income with adverse birth outcomes, cancer, premature and all-cause mortality, and communicable diseases. Most of the evidence indicates a strong association between ICERace-Income and each health outcome, underscoring income as a key mechanism by which segregation produces health inequality along racial and ethnic lines. Two of the reviewed studies examined racial disparities in comorbidities and health care access as potential explanatory factors underlying this relationship. We discuss our findings in the context of the extant literature on segregation and health and propose new directions for future research and applications of the ICERace-Income measure.},

We investigated neighborhood-level inequities across cities in the US and Canada for COVID-19 cumulative case rates (46 cities), death rates (12 cities), testing rates and test positivity (12 cities), using measures that characterize social gradients by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic composition, or both jointly. We found consistent evidence of social gradients for case, death and positivity rates, with the most privileged neighborhoods having the lowest rates, but no meaningful variation in the magnitude of inequities between cities. Gradients were not apparent in testing rates, suggesting inadequate testing in the most deprived neighborhoods. Health agencies should monitor and compare inequities as part of their COVID-19 reporting practices and to guide pandemic response efforts.
HIGHLIGHTSWithin urban regions with available data in the US and Canada, there were strong social gradients for case, death and positivity ratesThe most racially and/or economically privileged neighborhoods had the lowest ratesSocial gradients were similar for neighborhood-level measures of racial/ethnic composition, income, racialized economic segregation, and racialized occupational segregationTesting rates did not show consistent social gradients, which suggests that the most deprived neighborhoods have inadequate access to testing relative to their higher disease burden},

Methods In this article, we model county-level infrequent mask usage as a function of three pillars of conservatism: (1) Republican political leadership (percentage of votes for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election), (2) conservative Protestantism (percentage evangelical Christian), and (3) right-wing media consumption (Google searches for Fox News). Results Our analyses indicate that mask usage tends to be lower in counties with greater support for President Trump (in majority Trump counties), counties with more evangelical Christians, and areas with greater interest in Fox News. Conclusion Given the effectiveness of masks in limiting the transmission of respiratory droplets, conservative ideological resistance to public health and recommended pandemic lifestyles may indirectly support the spread of the coronavirus.},

Regression analyses examined how political preferences influenced the association between governors’ COVID-19 communications and residents’ mobility patterns. Governors’ recommendations for residents to stay at home preceded stay-at-home orders and led to a significant reduction in mobility that was comparable to the effect of the orders themselves. Effects were larger in Democratic- than in Republican-leaning counties, a pattern more pronounced under Republican governors. Democratic-leaning counties also responded more strongly to recommendations from Republican than from Democratic governors.

	abstract = {ObjectivesThe objective of this paper is to identify the risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection that are related to occupation type as well as workplace conditions. Identifying such risk factors could have noteworthy implications in workplace safety enhancement and emergency preparedness planning for essential workers.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of visits at a community-based SARS-CoV-2 testing site in the greater Boston area between March 18th and June 19th, 2020, for individuals between 14 and 65 years of age. Nasopharyngeal swab specimen, medical review, and self-administered questionnaire were obtained, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined with real-time, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Medical record-verified job classification, customer-facing, and work patterns were extracted from each individual's response through chart review and validated by licensed clinicians. The occupational patterns were coded by occupational medicine physicians with pre-specified criteria and were analyzed with logistic regression and inverse probability weighting.ResultsAmong the 780 individuals included in the final analysis, working in healthcare-related jobs was associated with a four-fold increase in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Adjusted OR: 4.00, 95\% CI: 1.45–11.02). Individuals with customer-facing jobs had a two times risk increase (Adjusted OR: 1.97, 95\% CI: 1.12–3.45) in having a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay result compared to participants with non-customer facing positions.ConclusionsIn this U.S. community-based population during the initial wave of the pandemic, a significant increase in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed in those employed in the healthcare sector or with customer-facing positions. Further research is warranted to determine if these correlations continued with the buildup of population immunity together with the attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 virulence.},

	abstract = {A number of authors have attempted to defend ecologic (aggregate) studies by claiming that the goal of those studies is estimation of ecologic (contextual or group-level) effects rather than individual-level effects. Critics of these attempts point out that ecologic effect estimates are inevitably used as estimates of individual effects, despite disclaimers. A more subtle problem is that ecologic variation in the distribution of individual effects can bias ecologic estimates of contextual effects. The conditions leading to this bias are plausible and perhaps even common in studies of ecosocial factors and health outcomes because social context is not randomized across typical analysis units (administrative regions). By definition, ecologic data contain only marginal observations on the joint distribution of individually defined confounders and outcomes, and so identify neither contextual nor individual-level effects. While ecologic studies can still be useful given appropriate caveats, their problems are better addressed by multilevel study designs, which obtain and use individual as well as group-level data. Nonetheless, such studies often share certain special problems with ecologic studies, including problems due to inappropriate aggregation and problems due to temporal changes in covariate distributions.},

	abstract = {By assuming that a simple multiplicative relationship exists between the age-specific mortality or morbidity rates for several populations, one is led to comparison of these populations using indirectly standardized mortality or morbidity ratios (SMR) where the age-specific rates for all populations combined are used as standards. Adjustments to these ratios are needed in case of large differences among the populations in both age-specific rates and age structures. This method is appropriate when insufficient data are available for direct standardization or when numbers of cases in individual age groups are so small as to make directly standardized rates unstable. It is oriented towards the internal comparison of specific sets of populations rather than production of synoptic figures for official publication. Extensions of the multiplicative hypothesis to the simultaneous analysis of multiple causes of mortality or morbidity suggest the use of a standardized relative mortality ratio (SRMR) for making comparisons when age-specific population denominators are not available. These methods are used to study several sets of cancer incidence and relative frequency data.},

	abstract = {During the coronavirus pandemic, policy makers need to interpret available public health data to make decisions affecting public health. However, the United States’ coronavirus response faced data gaps, inadequate and inconsistent definitions of data across different governmental jurisdictions, ambiguous timing in reporting, problems in accessing data, and changing interpretations from scientific institutions. These present numerous problems for the decision makers relying on this information. This paper documents some of the data pitfalls in coronavirus public health data reporting, as identified by the authors in the course of supporting data management for New England’s coronavirus response. We provide recommendations for individuals to collect data more effectively during emergency situations such as a COVID-19 surge, as well as recommendations for institutions to provide more meaningful data for various users to access. Through this, we hope to motivate action to avoid data pitfalls during public health responses in the future.},

	abstract = {Summary. Conventional smoothing methods sometimes perform badly when used to smooth data over complex domains, by smoothing inappropriately across boundary features, such as peninsulas. Solutions to this smoothing problem tend to be computationally complex, and not to provide model smooth functions which are appropriate for incorporating as components of other models, such as generalized additive models or mixed additive models. We propose a class of smoothers that are appropriate for smoothing over difficult regions of 2 which can be represented in terms of a low rank basis and one or two quadratic penalties. The key features of these smoothers are that they do not ‘smooth across’ boundary features, that their representation in terms of a basis and penalties allows straightforward incorporation as components of generalized additive models, mixed models and other non-standard models, that smoothness selection for these model components is straightforward to accomplish in a computationally efficient manner via generalized cross-validation, Akaike's information criterion or restricted maximum likelihood, for example, and that their low rank means that their use is computationally efficient.},

	abstract = {In spatial analysis, typically we specify a region of interest and consider a spatial surface over the region. It is often of interest to ascertain where the surface is changing rapidly. Identifying locations or curves where there is rapid change is referred to as wombling. The surface may arise continuously over the region or discretely, in which case values are provided for a collection of areal units. In either setting, algorithmic strategies are available to attempt to identify so-called wombling boundaries. In this study, the surfaces of interest are all assumed to be random, realizations of a Gaussian process in the continuous case, of a Markov random field in the discrete case. With specifications given as stochastic models, we discuss Bayesian approaches to implement desired boundary analysis. We refer to this as Bayesian wombling and show how fully model-based inference can be carried out, including assessment of uncertainty. The approach for the continuous case is more theoretically demanding (expected with an uncountable set of locations) but yields elegant distribution theory. The discrete case is more straightforward. Each case is illustrated with a brief example.
