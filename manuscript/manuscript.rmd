# Introduction

As we enter the third winter with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the
United States (U.S.), evidence reflecting intense disparities in COVID-19 mortality rates 
among socially advantaged and disadvantaged populations persists.  Eliminating
inequities in health outcomes is a major policy goal of the Biden
administration, representing an revitalized focus on health justice
and underlining the importance of adequate data reporting systems that measure
the prevalent health inequities.  To this end, generalized additive models
(GAMs) provide a flexible regression framework which can illustrate the evolving
roles and relationships social conditions have with trends in COVID-19
mortality.

# Background

Having passed over 1 million COVID-19 deaths in the United States earlier this
year, and facing uncertain prospects for the third COVID-19 winter looming even
as new iterations on the COVID-19 vaccines become available, it remains critical
that inequities in COVID-19 outcomes are documented and analyzed to reckon with
the unjust and unfair burden of preventable illness.  Even though the first
vaccines were granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in 2020, with the first shots going in arms in December 2020,
COVID-19 is still continuing to cause hundreds of deaths a day in the U.S. in
the late summer and early fall of 2022.  The new bivalent vaccines released at
the end of August 2022 contain messenger RNA components of the original strain
as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 lineages in an effort to make the nation's immunity
more up-to-date and robust against the myriad of phylogenetic directions the
COVID-19 virus is exploring.  Despite the updated bivalent boosters representing
a significant step forward in prevention strategy, less than 4% of eligible
Americans had taken the booster in the first month after it became available. As
such, and with an enduring history of inequities in health care availability, it
is not clear that all communities will be equally able to take advantage of the
new vaccines and inequities in COVID-19 illness and mortality may persist
despite the technological innovations in vaccine therapy.

# Methods

## Data Sources 

The following variables were retrieved at the county level: 

  * Counts of deaths by month with underlying cause of death as
  COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1) from CDC WONDER, Provisional Multiple Cause of Death
  Data
  * Population Size Estimates for 2020 from the U.S. Census (Redistricting 
  File Public-Law 94-171 Dataset). *Note:*  While the complete data for the 2020
  U.S. Census have not yet been released, the summary tables including
  population counts have been released as mandated by Congress for the purposes
  of redistricting and updating the boundaries of the 435 voting Congressional
  Districts, which are what is made us of here as population size estimates.
  * Percent Black, percent Hispanic, percent Asian, percent American Indian or
  Alaska Native, Percent below the federal poverty line, median household
  income, median age, percent 65 years or older, and percent 75 years or older
  from the 2014-2019 5-year American Community Survey. 
  *Note:* while more recent American Community Survey 5-year estimates are
  available, survey data collection in 2020 was severely affected by the
  pandemic with the 2020 data release denoted as "experimental".

## Generalized Additive Models 

# Results

We used GAMs to describe the following: 

  * the changing associations between individual area-based measures
  and COVID-19 mortality over time;
  * the changing associations between bivariate area-based measures
  and COVID-19 mortality over time; 
  * associations with area-based measures and COVID-19 mortality after
  controlling for spatio-temporal autocorrelation. 

Additionally, as sensitivity analyses, random forest models were fit to compare
with the coefficient estimates from the GAMs.

# Discussion


## Limitations

  * Missing data 
  * Ecological fallacy 
  * Age effects
  * Fixed population denominators -> real-time denominator estimates
  * Vaccination and mobility effects
