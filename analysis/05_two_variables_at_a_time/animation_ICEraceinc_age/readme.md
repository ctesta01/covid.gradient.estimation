# Static and Animated Presentations of the ICEraceinc and Age Interaction Over Time 

![six panels showing  A) May 2020, B) November 2020, C) May 2021, D) October 2021, E) February 2022, F) August 2022. To summarize, the effect starts out with a spike in the lowest ICE and highest age group regions. Then that spike starts to decline while the effect of low ICE measures becomes increasingly stronger at low age groups in November 2020. In May 2021, there is another sharp spike in low ages and high ICE values. Through October 2021 and February 2022 there is an increasing association with age and at lower age-groups an association with low ICE values. Finally in August 2022 the association with ICE is somewhat tempered from earlier in February and the effect of age remains quite strong.](panel_figure.png)
