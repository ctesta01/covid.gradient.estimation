A range of factors and spatial–temporal terms are incorporated into the model. The non-linear and interactive effects of the neighborhood-level factors, i.e., population density and average of income, are modeled as a two-dimensional spline smoother. The change of spatial pattern over time is modeled as a three-dimensional tensor product smoother. By fitting this model, the space–time effect can uncover the underlying spatial–temporal pattern that is not explained by the covariates. The performance of the modeling method based on the individual data is also compared to the modeling methods based on the aggregated data in terms of in-sample and out-of-sample predictive checking. The results suggest that the individual-level based analysis provided a better overall model fit and higher predictive accuracy for detecting epidemic peaks in this application as compared to the analysis based on the aggregated data.},

In this article we further substantiate the success story of GAMs, demonstrating their flexibility by focusing on three relevant pandemic-related issues. First, we examine the interdepency among infections in different age groups, concentrating on school children. In this context, we derive the setting under which parameter estimates are independent of the (unknown) case-detection ratio, which plays an important role in COVID-19 surveillance data. Second, we model the incidence of hospitalizations, for which data is only available with a temporal delay. We illustrate how correcting for this reporting delay through a nowcasting procedure can be naturally incorporated into the GAM framework as an offset term. Third, we propose a multinomial model for the weekly occupancy of intensive care units (ICU), where we distinguish between the number of COVID-19 patients, other patients and vacant beds. With these three examples, we aim to showcase the practical and ?off-the-shelf? applicability of GAMs to gain new insights from real-world data.},

Future work will continue to assess the influence of vaccines, including booster doses, as the pandemic progresses, and new variants emerge.Policy ImplicationsThis work highlights the importance of attaining full (two-dose) vaccination status and reinforces the notion that a second dose provides increased non-additive protection.

	abstract = {During 2020, the infection rate of COVID-19 has been investigated by many scholars from different research fields. In this context, reliable and interpretable forecasts of disease incidents are a vital tool for policymakers to manage healthcare resources. In this context, several experts have called for the necessity to account for human mobility to explain the spread of COVID-19. Existing approaches often apply standard models of the respective research field, frequently restricting modeling possibilities. For instance, most statistical or epidemiological models cannot directly incorporate unstructured data sources, including relational data that may encode human mobility. In contrast, machine learning approaches may yield better predictions by exploiting these data structures yet lack intuitive interpretability as they are often categorized as black-box models. We propose a combination of both research directions and present a multimodal learning framework that amalgamates statistical regression and machine learning models for predicting local COVID-19 cases in Germany. Results and implications: the novel approach introduced enables the use of a richer collection of data types, including mobility flows and colocation probabilities, and yields the lowest mean squared error scores throughout the observational period in the reported benchmark study. The results corroborate that during most of the observational period more dispersed meeting patterns and a lower percentage of people staying put are associated with higher infection rates. Moreover, the analysis underpins the necessity of including mobility data and showcases the flexibility and interpretability of the proposed approach.},

	doi = {10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30553-3},
	abstract = {Background
Within 4 months of COVID-19 first being reported in the USA, it spread to every state and to more than 90\% of all counties. During this period, the US COVID-19 response was highly decentralised, with stay-at-home directives issued by state and local officials, subject to varying levels of enforcement. The absence of a centralised policy and timeline combined with the complex dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission in the USA a challenge.
Methods
We used daily mobility data derived from aggregated and anonymised cell (mobile) phone data, provided by Teralytics (Zürich, Switzerland) from Jan 1 to April 20, 2020, to capture real-time trends in movement patterns for each US county, and used these data to generate a social distancing metric. We used epidemiological data to compute the COVID-19 growth rate ratio for a given county on a given day. Using these metrics, we evaluated how social distancing, measured by the relative change in mobility, affected the rate of new infections in the 25 counties in the USA with the highest number of confirmed cases on April 16, 2020, by fitting a statistical model for each county.
Findings
Our analysis revealed that mobility patterns are strongly correlated with decreased COVID-19 case growth rates for the most affected counties in the USA, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 0·7 for 20 of the 25 counties evaluated. Additionally, the effect of changes in mobility patterns, which dropped by 35–63\% relative to the normal conditions, on COVID-19 transmission are not likely to be perceptible for 9–12 days, and potentially up to 3 weeks, which is consistent with the incubation time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 plus additional time for reporting. We also show evidence that behavioural changes were already underway in many US counties days to weeks before state-level or local-level stay-at-home policies were implemented, implying that individuals anticipated public health directives where social distancing was adopted, despite a mixed political message.
Interpretation
This study strongly supports a role of social distancing as an effective way to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the USA. Until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, social distancing will remain one of the primary measures to combat disease spread, and these findings should serve to support more timely policy making around social distancing in the USA in the future.

This study examined county-level racial/ethnic disparities in human mobility and COVID-19 health outcomes during the year 2020 by leveraging geo-tracking data across the contiguous US. Sets of generalized additive models were fitted under cross-sectional and time-varying settings, with percentage of mobility change, percentage of staying home, COVID-19 infection rate, and case-fatality ratio as dependent variables, respectively. After adjusting for spatial effects, built environment, socioeconomics, demographics, and partisanship, we found counties with higher Asian populations decreased most in travel, counties with higher White and Asian populations experienced the least infection rate, and counties with higher African American populations presented the highest case-fatality ratio. Control variables, particularly partisanship and education attainment, significantly influenced modeling results. Time-varying analyses further suggested racial differences in human mobility varied dramatically at the beginning but remained stable during the pandemic, while racial differences in COVID-19 outcomes broadly decreased over time. All conclusions hold robust with different aggregation units or model specifications. Altogether, our analyses shine a spotlight on the entrenched racial segregation in the US as well as how it may influence the mobility patterns, urban forms, and health disparities during the COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Objective To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus. Methods We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R0 from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors—population between 20–34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality—as having strong relationships with R0, across countries. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R0 but were positive. Conclusion Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.},

	abstract = {Health inequities have long defined health and the healthcare system in the USA. The clinical and research capacity across the USA is unparalleled, yet compared to other high and even some middle-income countries, the average health indicators of the population remain suboptimal in 2020, a finding at least in part explained by inequity in healthcare access. In this context, COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a major threat to the public’s health. While it was initially thought that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 would be the great equaliser as it would not discriminate, it is clear that COVID-19 incidence and mortality have rapidly reinforced health disparities drawn by historical and contemporary inequities. Here, we synthesise the data highlighting specific risks among particular marginalised and under-resourced communities including those in jails, prisons and detention centers, immigrants and the undocumented, people with disabilities and people experiencing homelessness across the USA. The drivers of these disparities are pervasive structural risks including limited access to preventive services, inability to comply with physical distancing recommendations, underlying health disparities and intersecting stigmas particularly affecting racial and ethnic minorities across the country, including African Americans, Latinx Americans and Native Americans. Advancing the COVID-19 response, saving lives and restarting the economy necessitate rapidly addressing these inequities rather than ignoring and even reinforcing them.},

Ageism and stereotypes of older people in general can have an important impact on elders’ physical and mental health and well-being. For example, internalized negative stereotypes can produce self-fulfilling prophecies through stereotype embodiment and contribute to weakness and dependency. Ageist beliefs and stereotypes can interfere with health care seeking as well as with diagnosis and treatment recommendations; they can, for example, contribute to gender disparities in the health care of older adults if older women are perceived as too frail to undergo aggressive treatments. Ageism also results in disrespectful treatment of older patients, which is communicated through baby talk and other forms of infantilization or the shrugging off of patients’ complaints and concerns as “just old age.” Intersectional identities can result in a cumulative burden for older women patients who may have a history of disrespectful treatment for other reasons (e.g., sexism, racism, bias against lesbians). Reduction of ageism and sexism and promotion of more realistic and diverse views of older women could improve doctor–patient relationships, facilitate adherence to treatment regimens, and reduce disparities in health and health care.},

	abstract = {Background Probability and nonprobability-based studies of US transgender persons identify different disparities in health and health care access. Objectives We used TransPop, the first US national probability survey of transgender persons, to describe and compare measures of health and health access among transgender, nonbinary, and cisgender participants. We directly compared the results with 2015 US Transgender Survey (USTS) data and with previously published analyses from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Methods All participants were screened by Gallup Inc., which recruited a probability sample of US adults. Transgender people were identified using a two-step screening process. Eligible participants completed self-administered questionnaires (transgender n = 274, cisgender n = 1162). We obtained weighted proportions/means, then tested for differences between gender groups. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate associations. Bivariate analyses were conducted using the weighted USTS data set for shared variables in USTS and TransPop. Results Transgender participants were younger and more racially diverse compared to the cisgender group. Despite equally high insurance coverage, transgender people more often avoided care due to cost concerns. Nonbinary persons were less likely to access transgender-related health care providers/clinics than transgender men and women. Transgender respondents more often rated their health as fair/poor, with more frequently occuring poor physical and mental health days compared to cisgender participants. Health conditions including HIV, emphysema, and ulcer were higher among transgender people. TransPop and USTS, unlike BRFSS-based analyses, showed no differences in health or health access. Discussion Transgender persons experience health access disparities centered on avoidance of care due to cost beyond insured status. Health disparities correspond with models of minority stress, with nonbinary persons having distinct health/health access patterns. Despite different sampling methods, USTS and TransPop appear more similar than BRFSS studies regarding health/health access. Conclusion Future research should elucidate health care costs for transgender and nonbinary people, while addressing methodology in national studies of transgender health.},

	abstract = {Background
The LGBTQ health disparities literature documents barriers to comprehensive and queer-inclusive care. Queer cisgender women and gender expansive individuals assigned female at birth experience myriad health disparities related to reproductive health, in part owing to the health care system. However, few studies have examined how queer individuals cope with and overcome barriers to queer-competent reproductive health care. This study aims to understand the strategies queer cisgender women and gender expansive individuals use to meet their reproductive health needs.
Methods
Investigators conducted interviews with 22 queer cisgender women and gender expansive individuals assigned female at birth about their experiences seeking reproductive health care services. We used inductive coding and thematic analysis to identify themes related to meeting reproductive health and health care needs.
Results
Findings highlight the prevalence of negative and harmful experiences while seeking reproductive health care. In response to these negative experiences, individuals developed active strategies to meet their health needs, including seeking information and community, seeking alternative models of care, and managing identity disclosure. Importantly, these strategies varied in effectiveness, depending on participants' social and economic advantage.
Conclusions
Queer individuals face numerous barriers to queer-competent reproductive health care when seeking reproductive health services. While queer patients are often resilient and creative, developing strategies to get their needs met, the presence of such strategies highlights the need for structural changes in the health system to better serve queer patients.},

	abstract = {Background Prior studies have noted significant health disadvantages experienced by LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) populations in the US. While several studies have identified that fears or experiences of stigma and disclosure of sexual orientation and/or gender identity to health care providers are significant barriers to health care utilization for LGBT people, these studies have concentrated almost exclusively on urban samples. Little is known about the impact of stigma specifically for rural LGBT populations, who may have less access to quality, LGBT-sensitive care than LGBT people in urban centers. Methodology LBGT individuals residing in rural areas of the United States were recruited online to participate in a survey examining the relationship between stigma, disclosure and “outness,” and utilization of primary care services. Data were collected and analyzed regarding LGBT individuals’ demographics, health care access, health risk factors, health status, outness to social contacts and primary care provider, and anticipated, internalized, and enacted stigmas. Results Higher scores on stigma scales were associated with lower utilization of health services for the transgender \& non-binary group, while higher levels of disclosure of sexual orientation were associated with greater utilization of health services for cisgender men. Conclusions The results demonstrate the role of stigma in shaping access to primary health care among rural LGBT people and point to the need for interventions focused towards decreasing stigma in health care settings or increasing patients’ disclosure of orientation or gender identity to providers. Such interventions have the potential to increase utilization of primary and preventive health care services by LGBT people in rural areas.},

We provide empirical illustrations to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed tests. The finite sample size and power performance of the tests are also investigated through a Monte Carlo study. The results indicate that the adjusted LM tests have good finite sample properties. In addition, they prove to be more suitable for the identification of the source of dependence (lag or error) than their unadjusted counterparts.},

	abstract = {Background
People from racial minority groups in western countries experience disproportionate socioeconomic and structural determinants of health disadvantages. These disadvantages have led to inequalities and inequities in health care access and poorer health outcomes. We report disproportionate disparities in prevalence, hospitalisation, and deaths from COVID-19 by racial minority populations.

Methods
We conducted a systematic literature search of relevant databases to identify studies reporting on prevalence, hospitalisations, and deaths from COVID-19 by race groups between 01 January 2020 – 15 April 2021. We grouped race categories into Blacks, Hispanics, Whites and Others. Random effects model using the method of DerSimonian and Laird were fitted, and forest plot with respective ratio estimates and 95\% confidence interval (CI) for each race category, and subgroup meta-regression analyses and the overall pooled ratio estimates for prevalence, hospitalisation and mortality rate were presented.

Results
Blacks experienced significantly higher burden of COVID-19: prevalence ratio 1.79 (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.59-1.99), hospitalisation ratio 1.87 (95\% CI = 1.69-2.04), mortality ratio 1.68 (95\% CI = 1.52-1.83), compared to Whites: prevalence ratio 0.70 (95\% CI = 0.0.64-0.77), hospitalisation ratio 0.74 (95\% CI = 0.65-0.82), mortality ratio 0.82 (95\% CI = 0.78-0.87). Also, Hispanics experienced a higher burden: prevalence ratio 1.78 (95\% CI = 1.63-1.94), hospitalisation ratio 1.32 (95\% CI = 1.08-1.55), mortality ratio 0.94 (95\% CI = 0.84-1.04) compared to Whites. A higher burden was also observed for Other race groups: prevalence ratio 1.43 (95\% CI = 1.19-1.67), hospitalisation ratio 1.12 (95\% CI = 0.89-1.35), mortality ratio 1.06 (95\% CI = 0.89-1.23) compared to Whites. The disproportionate burden among Blacks and Hispanics remained following correction for publication bias.

Conclusions
Blacks and Hispanics have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. This is deeply concerning and highlights the systemically entrenched disadvantages (social, economic, and political) experienced by racial minorities in western countries; and this study underscores the need to address inequities in these communities to improve overall health outcomes.},

	abstract = {The United States (US) has been among those nations most severely affected by the first—and subsequent—phases of the pandemic of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. With only 4\% of the worldwide population, the US has seen about 22\% of COVID-19 deaths. Despite formidable advantages in resources and expertise, presently the per capita mortality rate is over 585/million, respectively 2.4 and 5 times higher compared to Canada and Germany. As we enter Fall 2020, the US is enduring ongoing outbreaks across large regions of the country. Moreover, within the US, an early and persistent feature of the pandemic has been the disproportionate impact on populations already made vulnerable by racism and dangerous jobs, inadequate wages, and unaffordable housing, and this is true for both the headline public health threat and the additional disastrous economic impacts. In this article we assess the impact of missteps by the Federal Government in three specific areas: the introduction of the virus to the US and the establishment of community transmission; the lack of national COVID-19 workplace standards and enforcement, and lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for workplaces as represented by complaints to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) which we find are correlated with deaths 16 days later (ρ = 0.83); and the total excess deaths in 2020 to date already total more than 230,000, while COVID-19 mortality rates exhibit severe—and rising—inequities in race/ethnicity, including among working age adults.},

	abstract = {Objective:
To overcome the absence of national, state, and local public health data on the unequal economic and social burden of COVID-19 in the United States. 
Design:
We analyze US county COVID-19 deaths and confirmed COVID-19 cases and positive COVID-19
tests in Illinois and New York City zip codes by area percent poverty, percent crowding, percent population of color, and the Index of Concentration at the Extremes. 
Setting:
US counties and zip codes in Illinois and New York City, as of May 5, 2020. 
Main Outcome
Measures:
Rates, rate differences, and rate ratios of COVID-19 mortality, confirmed cases, and positive tests by category of county and zip code–level area-based socioeconomic measures. 
Results:
As of May 5, 2020, the COVID-19 death rate per 100 000 person-years
equaled the following: 143.2 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 140.9, 145.5) vs 83.3 (95\% CI: 78.3, 88.4) in high versus low poverty counties (≥20\% vs {\textless}5\% of persons below poverty); 124.4 (95\% CI: 122.7, 126.0) versus 48.2 (95\% CI: 47.2, 49.2) in counties in the top versus bottom quintile
for household crowding; and 127.7 (95\% CI: 126.0, 129.4) versus 25.9 (95\% CI: 25.1, 26.6) for counties in the top versus bottom quintile for the percentage of persons who are people of color. Socioeconomic gradients in Illinois confirmed cases and New York City positive tests by zip code–level
area-based socioeconomic measures were also observed. 
Conclusions:
Stark social inequities exist in the United States for COVID-19 outcomes. We recommend that public health departments use these straightforward cost-effective methods to report on social inequities in COVID-19
outcomes to provide an evidence base for policy and resource allocation.},

The objective of the study is to understand the spatial determinants of the pandemic in counties across the U.S. by comparing socioeconomic variables to case and death data from January 22nd to June 30th 2020. A cluster analysis was performed to examine areas of high-risk, followed by a three-stage regression to examine contextual factors associated with elevated risk patterns for morbidity and mortality. The factors associated with community-level vulnerability included age, disability, language, race, occupation, and urban status. We recommend that cluster detection and spatial analysis be included in population-based surveillance strategies to better inform early case detection and prioritize healthcare resources.},

A cross-sectional research design linked data from Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services, American Community Survey, the 2010 Census, and COVID-19 cases among the general population and nursing homes. Spatial cluster analysis identified specific regions with statistically higher COVID-19 cases and deaths among residents. Multivariate analysis identified risk factors at the nursing home level including, total count of fines, total staffing levels, and LPN staffing levels. County-level or place-based factors like per-capita income, average household size, population density, and minority composition were significant predictors of COVID-19 cases in the nursing home.

Due to inadequate research on geographic modeling of COVID-19, we investigated county-level variations of disease incidence across the continental United States. We compiled a geodatabase of 35 environmental, socioeconomic, topographic, and demographic variables that could explain the spatial variability of disease incidence. Further, we employed spatial lag and spatial error models to investigate spatial dependence and geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) models to locally examine spatial non-stationarity. The results suggested that even though incorporating spatial autocorrelation could significantly improve the performance of the global ordinary least square model, these models still represent a significantly poor performance compared to the local models. Moreover, MGWR could explain the highest variations (adj. R2: 68.1\%) with the lowest AICc compared to the others. Mapping the effects of significant explanatory variables (i.e., income inequality, median household income, the proportion of black females, and the proportion of nurse practitioners) on spatial variability of COVID-19 incidence rates using MGWR could provide useful insights to policymakers for targeted interventions.},

	abstract = {The geographic areas most impacted by COVID-19 may not remain static because public health measures/behaviors change dynamically, and the impacts of pandemic vulnerability also may vary geographically and temporally. The nature of the pandemic makes spatiotemporal methods essential to understanding the distribution of COVID-19 deaths and developing interventions. This study examines the spatiotemporal trends in COVID-19 death rates in the United States from March 2020 to May 2021 by performing an emerging hot spot analysis (EHSA). It then investigates the effects of the COVID-19 time-dependent and basic social vulnerability factors on COVID-19 death rates using geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR). The EHSA results demonstrate that over the three phases of the pandemic (first wave, second wave, and post-vaccine deployment), hot spots have shifted from densely populated cities and the states with a high percentage of socially vulnerable individuals to the states with relatively relaxed social distancing requirements, and then to the states with low vaccination rates. The GTWR results suggest that local infection and testing rates, social distancing interventions, and other social, environmental, and health risk factors show significant associations with COVID-19 death rates, but these associations vary over time and space. These findings can inform public health planning.},
